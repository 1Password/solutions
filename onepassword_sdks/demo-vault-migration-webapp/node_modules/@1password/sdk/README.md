## ðŸš€ Get started

To use the 1Password JavaScript SDK in your project:

1. [Create a service account](https://my.1password.com/developer-tools/infrastructure-secrets/serviceaccount/) and give it the appropriate permissions in the vaults where the items you want to use with the SDK are saved.
2. Provision your service account token. We recommend provisioning your token from the environment. For example, to export your token to the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable:

   **macOS or Linux**

   ```bash
   export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token>
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```powershell
   $Env:OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN = "<your-service-account-token>"
   ```

3. Install the 1Password JavaScript SDK in your project:

   ```bash
   ## NPM
   npm install @1password/sdk
   ```

   ```bash
   ## PNPM
   pnpm add @1password/sdk
   ```

   ```bash
   ## Yarn
   yarn add @1password/sdk
   ```

4. Use the JavaScript SDK in your project:

```js
import { createClient } from "@1password/sdk";

// Creates an authenticated client.
const client = await createClient({
  auth: process.env.OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN,
  // Set the following to your own integration name and version.
  integrationName: "My 1Password Integration",
  integrationVersion: "v1.0.0",
});

// Fetches a secret.
const secret = await client.secrets.resolve("op://vault/item/field");
```

Make sure to use [secret reference URIs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax/) with the syntax `op://vault/item/field` to securely load secrets from 1Password into your code.

Inside `createClient()`, set `integrationName` to the name of your application and `integrationVersion` to the version of your application.
