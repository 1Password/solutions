# Migration tools

## Migrating from LastPass

The [lastpass-vault-item-import](lastpass-vault-item-import.py) script will create vaults and login items from a LastPass export generated through their web-based exported or the lpass CLI (this has not been tested on exports from their browser extension or other methods). Shared Nested folders in 1Password will have separate, non-nested vaults created. Items not belonging to any shared folder will be created in the user's Private vault.takes a .csv export generated by LastPass (either from their web exported or using the `lpass export` with the LastPass CLI).

### Dependencies

Python, 1Password CLI

#### Python

This script requires Python. Python is integrated into many computer operating systems, but if you do not already have Python installed, please install the correct version for your operating system from the official [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) website or the package manager of your choosing.

#### 1Password's CLI tool

This script relies on the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) tool. Please install and add your account to the 1Password CLI tool prior to running this script.

### Consider 1Password's web-based importer

If you do not feel comforatble with running scripts, cannot install dependencies, or are looking for a simpler solution to migrating your items from LastPass to 1Password, consider using the LastPass importer by logging into your account at 1Password.com

You can learn more about importing your items from LastPass using our browser-based importer here: <https://support.1password.com/import-lastpass/>

### Notes

#### Limitations

This script only migrates Login items. It will not migrate credit cards, secure notes, or any other item type.

At this time, this script will not migrate TOTP secrets. You will have to manually migrate those from LastPass to 1Password, or reconfigured 2FA on the websites you use it on.

#### Unencrypted exports

The LastPass export is unencrypted. As such, additional precuations are necessary to maintain the confidentiality of the data in your exports.
Prior to exporting your LastPass data, consider the following steps:

1. Ensure you are using a computer you trust and which you do not suspect of being compromised in any way.
2. Disable all backup software prior to exporting your LastPass data.
3. Delete the LastPass export file immidately after running this script.
4. Re-enable any backup software you were previously running.

#### Private folders

Please note that there is no mechanism to migrate other users' private LastPass items on their behalf. This means if you are part of an organization, each of your team members will have to migrate their own private LastPass data to their 1Password account.

#### Shared folders

The LastPass exporter may include all shared folders a user has access to. This means shared folders my appear in multiple people's LastPass exports. To avoid duplicating shared items and vaults upon migration, you may want to coordinate who migrates shared folders. For example, you may delegate the migration specific shared folders to certain people, or all shared folders to a single administrator. You may want to revoke other people's access to shared folders during the migration to avoid them showing up in multiple people's exports  and ensure that each shared folder and it's items are migrated exactly one time.
