# Examples, templates, and other goodies from the 1Password Solutions team

## Introduction
The 1Password [Command Line Interface](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) (called `op` from this point forward) allows you to manage some aspects of a 1Password account, use secure secrets references to avoid storing secrets as plaintext environment variables, and perform CRUD actions on items you store in 1Password. 

This repository contains example and demo scripts for `op` with the intent of providing people with inspiration or a starting point for their own scripts. 

The scripts here assume you have the `op` [installed and configured](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started). 

Unless otherwise stated, these scripts are not intended to be run in an automated or unattended environment.
